## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on COVID-19 Pandemic in the United Kingdom

In this Jupyter notebook, I will be conducting an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on three datasets related to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. The datasets I have chosen are Deaths.csv, Vaccinations.csv, and ConfirmedCasesByDateReported.csv. The 'areaName' column in ConfirmedCasesByDateReported.csv and Deaths.csv only contain 'United Kingdom'. The 'areaName' column in Vaccinations.csv, only contain information for the four countries that make up the United Kingdom.

I will use pandas to manipulate and explore the datasets, and I will also be using visualizations to better understand the data. In particular, I will be using random forest for predictive analysis.

Feel free to explore the Jupyter notebook and the code I have written to see my data exploration process and analysis. I hope that this EDA will provide some insights into the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom and contribute to the ongoing efforts to combat the spread of the virus.

Please note that this analysis was done using data available as of September 2021
