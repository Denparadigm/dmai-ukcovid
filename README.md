## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on COVID-19 Pandemic in the United Kingdom

In this Jupyter notebook, we conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on three datasets related to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. The datasets we have chosen are Deaths.csv, Vaccinations.csv, and ConfirmedCasesByDateReported.csv. The 'areaName' column in ConfirmedCasesByDateReported.csv and Deaths.csv only contain 'United Kingdom'. The 'areaName' column in Vaccinations.csv, only contain information for the four countries that make up the United Kingdom.

We use pandas to manipulate and explore the datasets, and we also use visualizations to better understand the data. In particular, we will be using random forest for predictive analysis.

Feel free to explore the Jupyter notebook and the code we have written to see our data exploration process and analysis. We hope that this EDA will provide some insights into the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom and contribute to the ongoing efforts to combat the spread of the virus.

Please note that this analysis was done using data available as of September 2021. Any new data that has been added since then may affect the findings and conclusions of this analysis.
